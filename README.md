# BusUI - Java Bus Simulation App

BusUI Logo

BusUI is a Java application that simulates buses traveling along various cities in Portugal with passengers. The app showcases the use of multithreading to manage the movement of buses, passenger interactions, and various events that occur during the simulation. This repository serves as a demonstration of the developer's understanding of multithreading, JavaFX, and object-oriented programming.
Features

    Simulation of buses traveling between Portuguese cities.
    Passengers boarding and alighting at different city stops.
    Buses traveling along roads and cities, updating their locations.
    Maintenance and malfunction events affecting the buses.
    Multithreading to handle concurrent processes and smooth user interface interaction.

How to Run

To run the BusUI application, you need to have Java 8 or later installed on your computer. Follow these steps:

    Clone the repository: Use Git to clone the BusUI repository to your local machine.

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/PhonyZ0n3/BusUI.git

    Open the project: Import the project into your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

    Build the project: Make sure the required dependencies are resolved and build the project.

    Run the application: Locate the mainApplication.java file and run it as a Java application.

    Enjoy the simulation: Interact with the application to observe buses moving between cities, picking up and dropping off passengers, and responding to events.

Usage

    Main Scene: Upon running the application, you will be presented with the main scene. This scene represents the simulation of buses and passengers.

    Bus Actions: The status label at the bottom of the main scene displays the actions performed by the buses, such as "Arrived at City," "Picking up passengers," "Travelling at City," and more.

    Passenger List: The application displays a list of passengers onboard each bus in the passenger table view.

    Multithreading: The simulation is designed using multithreading to ensure smooth interactions and responsiveness of the user interface.

Dependencies

The BusUI application utilizes JavaFX for the graphical user interface.
